First, I removed all the original CSS that was in the html file. Then I proceeded to create a CSS file that would be shared between all of them.
This part was tricky as the HTML used varying and inconsistant formating between books. I had to settle for generalized specifiers for the CSS in order to
achieve semi consistent results. For the theme and the colour scheme, I choose something simple as "simplicity is the mother of all beauty -My Highscool IT teacher".
I wanted a theme that I would actually use and be comfortable reading, The serif font made everything feel old and rustic and the background colour was pleasing to the eye and gave off a nostalgic feeling. I then kept tweaking the spacing, alignment and overall look and feel of the paragraphs themselves. I choose to  text-align-last: center; as I felt that It made converstations with short paragraphs more interesting to read while not affecting longer paragraphs and still allowing me to indent, which is somehting I find very important personally. I then proceeded to modify the headers and stylize them to visually indicate to the reader that a chapter is over and they can take a break now or prepare for a change. The links were also modified to fit the colourscheme. Hovering over links now changes and underlines them and visiting them changes the colour. the colours were chosen that way inorder to not be too bright as to annoy the reader if links were found in the middle of paragraphs. Finally Images were modified and figcaptions' stylization was added. This layout influenced my homepage https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-website-layout/
