                    I am a jack of all trades and a generalist that can make anything happen. I know how to do everything from game developement to first aid to organizing an event for over 2000 peole and more. If someone else has done it before I can find a way to make it happen for you. Even if you want to achieve something no one has ever done before We can work together to make it happen.
